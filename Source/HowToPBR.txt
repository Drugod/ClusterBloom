SPECULAR MAPS
Specular maps are the maps you use to define a surface's shininess and highlight colour.
The higher the value of a pixel (from black to white), the shinier the surface will appear on scene.
Therefore, surfaces such as dry stone or cotton fabric would tend to have a very dark specular map,
while surfaces like polished chrome or plastic would tend to have lighter specular maps.
The colour of a pixel is also used, to calculate the resulting colour of the surface.
A very saturated specular map will have a very different visual effect than a grey specular map.
If you need a more "neutral" highlight on a surface, your specular map should use the inverse of the diffuse map's colour.
Using the same colour on the specular as on the diffuse will result in a more saturated highlight when viewed in the scene.
You can use contrasts in specular to make a surface appear more visually interesting in the scene.
